# manifests

Currently, applicationset.yaml is being `kubectl apply`d manually.

`ingress\spec\rules\host` should be adjusted based on the IP of the cluster it lands in.

still need to rework how image tags get updated

# notes

repos are generic secrets with special labels! this needs to be automated when we get to handling secret data
